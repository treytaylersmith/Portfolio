    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
     
    &emsp; I am a full stack web developer with 7 years of experience in software development, specializing in both front-end and back-end technologies. My journey in coding began in high school, where I learned Java and developed a strong foundation in programming principles. During college, I transitioned into game development, gaining hands-on experience with tools like Unreal Engine, as well as UX/UI design and Audio Engineering. Working alongside talented teams of artists, directors, and game designers, I contributed to projects that emphasized storytelling and interactive media.

    <p>
    &emsp; After completing my degree, I made a deliberate shift from game design to web development. I enrolled in EdX's Web Development program, where I honed my skills in building responsive websites, dynamic web applications, and API integrations. I gained proficiency in a wide range of technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and SQL. Through the development of various front-end, back-end, and full-stack applications, I’ve built a strong understanding of the entire web development lifecycle, from user interface design to server-side logic and database management.

    <p>
    &emsp; As a passionate problem solver, I am committed to creating seamless, user-friendly digital experiences that drive business value. My expertise in both UX/UI design and full-stack development allows me to bridge the gap between technical functionality and user experience, delivering high-quality, intuitive applications. I am eager to bring my skills to a collaborative team environment, where I can continue to grow and contribute to the success of innovative web development projects.

    <p>
    &emsp; I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills in web development, front-end frameworks, back-end solutions, and full-stack programming to help businesses and clients achieve their goals. Whether building dynamic web applications or optimizing existing platforms, I am dedicated to delivering scalable and efficient solutions.
