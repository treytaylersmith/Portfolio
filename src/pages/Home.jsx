    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     
    &emsp; I am a <b>full stack web developer</b> with 7 years of experience in software development. My journey in coding began in high school, where I learned Java and developed a strong foundation in programming principles. During college, I transitioned into game development, gaining hands-on experience with tools like <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>, as well as <strong>UX/UI design</strong> and <strong>Audio Engineering</strong>. Working alongside talented teams of artists, directors, and game designers, I contributed to projects that emphasized storytelling and interactive media.
    </p>
    <p>
    &emsp; After completing my degree, I made a deliberate shift from game design to web development. I enrolled in EdX's Web Development program, where I honed my skills in building responsive websites, dynamic web applications, and <strong>API integration</strong>s. I gained proficiency in a wide range of technologies, including <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>. Through the development of various front-end, back-end, and full-stack applications, I’ve built a strong understanding of the entire web development lifecycle, from user interface design to <strong>server-side logic</strong> and <strong>database management</strong>.
</p>
    <p>
    &emsp; As a passionate problem solver, I am committed to creating seamless, user-friendly digital experiences that drive business value. My expertise in both UX/UI design and full-stack development allows me to bridge the gap between technical functionality and user experience, delivering high-quality, intuitive applications. I am eager to bring my skills to a collaborative team environment, where I can continue to grow and contribute to the success of innovative web development projects.
</p>
    <p>
    &emsp; I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills in web development, front-end frameworks, back-end solutions, and full-stack programming to help businesses and clients achieve their goals. Whether building dynamic web applications or optimizing existing platforms, I am dedicated to delivering scalable and efficient solutions. Let’s connect and explore how I can contribute to your next project!
